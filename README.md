# Chrysalis Private Tangle Docker image

This is an easy way to spawn a preconfigured Chrysalis Private Tangle using Hornet and Docker.

It is faster to set up than [the official tutorial](https://wiki.iota.org/hornet/getting_started/private_tangle) as it does everything automatically.

## How to set up

- Assuming you have Docker and docker-compose installed, you can just `cd` to the directory of this repo after cloning it, and execute `docker-compose up -d`. Dashboard is accessible at http://localhost:8081 and API is at http://localhost:14265.
